This is AMON-SENSS, software for scalable detection of DDoS attacks and
creation of signatures for attack filtering. Signatures and alerts are
exported in real time into alerts.txt file. You will soon discover when
you run this tool that there are many attacks that get detected. This is
an unfortunate fact -- today's traffic is often one-way and has many
anomalies that AMON-SENSS picks up. You can use read_alerts tool to narrow
down just to attacks for which we have high confidence. 

==== INSTALLATION ====

See the INSTALL file for detailed information about how to configure
and install AMON-SENSS.

Run the Perl script autoconfig to configure the parameters via a dialogue. 
Specifically, parameter min_oci will govern how large an estimated attack's
packet rate must be to warrant printing an alert. If you are seeing too many
alerts try specifying a higher value for min_oci. However, you can always
increase RATE parameter in read_alerts to only focus on high-rate attacks.

==== RUNNING ====

To run please specify prefixes you want to protect in localprefs.txt file.
A sample file is provided. Replace its contents with your own.

Service ports of interest are in services.txt file. You don't need to change
this file.

Typical usage:
  ./amonsenss -r /folder-w-nfdump -F nf -f > /dev/null

AMON-SENSS expects as input one or more files with Netflow records
(nfdump or flow-tools format), pcap or Flowride records.
If you specify a folder holding these files, possibly in some subfolders,
the program will read all the folder(s)
contents, sort by file name and process files in this order.

AMON-SENSS produces alerts in alerts.txt file in real time. Ongoing attacks
will result in steady stream of alerts. AMON-SENSS uses a simple bash script -- rotate --
to rotate this file.

If you run the code with -v flag, it will also produce debugging output, which is
very verbose. So use this option sparingly.

Use read_alerts tool to get condensed START/STOP messages for attacks.

perl read_alerts alerts.txt

This tool will read alerts.txt on ongoing basis and produce human-readable,
low volume of actionable alerts. If you rotate alerts.txt you will need to
restart read_alerts as well.

AMON-SENSS has a Web page, with accompanying tools that can help you respond
to attacks that are detected (although many are research grade)

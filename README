This is AMON-SENSS, software for scalable detection of DDoS attacks and
creation of signatures for attack filtering. Signatures and alerts are
exported in real time into alerts.txt file. You will soon discover when
you run this tool that there are many attacks that get detected. This is
an unfortunate fact -- today's traffic has many DDoS attacks present.
Many are low volume or low duration and may not require a response. You
can write another tool that parses alerts.txt and decides which attacks are
sufficiently large and sufficiently long to require a response. In that case
you can use the provided signature for the response.

See the INSTALL file for detailed information about how to configure
and install AMON-SENSS.

Run the Perl script asc to configure the parameters via a dialogue. 

To understand how AMON-SENSS works download the document
http://www.isi.edu/~mirkovic/amon-senss.pdf

AMON-SENSS expects as input one or more files with Netflow records
(nfdump or flow-tools format). If you specify a folder holding these
files, possibly in some subfolders, the program will read the folder(s)
contents, sort by file name and process files in this order.

AMON-SENSS has a Web page, with accompanying tools that can help you respond
to attacks that are detected

This is AMON-SENSS, software for scalable detection of DDoS attacks and
creation of signatures for attack filtering. Signatures and alerts are
exported in real time into alerts.txt file. You will soon discover when
you run this tool that there are many attacks that get detected. This is
an unfortunate fact -- today's traffic is often one-way and has many
anomalies that AMON-SENSS picks up. You can use read_alerts tool to narrow
down just to attacks for which we have high confidence. 

See the INSTALL file for detailed information about how to configure
and install AMON-SENSS.

Run the Perl script amon-senss.config to configure the parameters via a dialogue. 

If you are feeding sampled Netflow records that are not upsampled by nfdump
then enable UPSAMPLE flag in as.cc and provide the upsampling logic between
"UPSAMPLE start" and "UPSAMPLE end" (the logic shown is for the case where
one router was upsampling with factor 100 and the other did not upsample - we
correct this knowing that other router's sampling rate was 4,096).

AMON-SENSS has a Web page, with accompanying tools that can help you respond
to attacks that are detected

=======================================================================
AMON-SENSS expects as input one or more files with Netflow records
(nfdump or flow-tools format), pcap or Flowride records.
If you specify a folder holding these
files, possibly in some subfolders, the program will read the folder(s)
contents, sort by file name and process files in this order.

AMON-SENSS produces alerts in alerts.txt file in real time.

If you run it with -v flag, it will also produce debugging output, which is
very verbose.
